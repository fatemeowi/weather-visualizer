# Weather Visualizer

**Weather Visualizer** is a Python project that generates, analyzes, and visualizes temperature data over a 30-day period. It demonstrates skills in **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **data manipulation**, **categorization**, and **data visualization** using `matplotlib`.

The program simulates daily temperatures between 5°C and 35°C, stores each day's data in a `weatherdata` class instance, categorizes days into Cold (<15°C), Mild (15–25°C), and Hot (>25°C), counts the number of days in each category, and displays a **pie chart** showing the proportion of each temperature range with colors: Cold (Skyblue), Mild (Gold), Hot (Tomato).

## How to Run (Step by Step)

1. **Install Python 3**: Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. **Install matplotlib**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```pip install matplotlib```
3. **Download the project**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
4. **Run the script**: Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run:
```python weather_visualizer.py```
5. **Input and Output**: The script will generate random temperature data for 30 days and automatically display a pie chart showing the distribution of Cold, Mild, and Hot days.

## Example Output

- Cold (<15°C): 20%
- Mild (15–25°C): 50%
- Hot (>25°C): 30%
*(Percentages will vary since data is randomly generated.)*

**Key Skills Demonstrated:** Python programming, OOP, data categorization, data visualization, matplotlib.
